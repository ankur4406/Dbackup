Most people never know that they have been infected with the virus.\\xa0It is estimated that four\\xa0out of five people with Zika virus infections have no symptoms at all.\\xa0When symptoms do occur, the most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). Even in those who develop symptoms, the illness is usually mild, with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. A pregnant woman applies mosquito repellant. Using insect repellants will help to protect her from being bitten by a mosquito that may be carrying a virus such as Zika; this will also protect her unborn baby from the virus. (Image: CDC/Division of Vector-borne Diseases)Locations AffectedPrior to 2015, Zika virus outbreaks had occurred in areas of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. However, in May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert \\xa0(PDF, 199 KB) regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infection in Brazil. Currently, outbreaks are occurring in many countries.Imported Zika virus disease\\xa0cases have been reported in returning travelers. These imported cases could potentially result in local spread of the virus in some areas of the continental\\xa0United States.On July 29, 2016, CDC announced that likely local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission has been reported in the continental United States. Locally transmitted Zika virus has also been reported in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.Guillain-Barr\\xe9 SyndromeSince the outbreak in Brazil began, we have seen reports of Guillain-Barr\\xe9 syndrome (a disorder\\xa0in which the immune system attacks the nervous system) and birth defects.\\xa0\\xa0More: Zika Virus Disease Q&A, from CDCPregnancyZika virus can be transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have concluded, after careful review of existing evidence, that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly,\\xa0a condition in which a baby\\u2019s brain and head is smaller than expected,\\xa0and other severe fetal brain defects. In the April 13, 2016\\xa0report \\xa0published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC authors describe a rigorous weighing of evidence using established scientific criteria.The finding that Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects means that a woman who is infected with Zika during pregnancy has an increased risk of having a baby with these health problems. It does not mean, however, that all women who have Zika virus infection during pregnancy will have babies with problems. As has been seen during the current Zika outbreak, some infected women have delivered babies that appear to be healthy.

While Miami-Dade County is the only part of Florida currently (July 29, 2016 to present) designated by CDC as an area of active ZIKV transmission for the purposes of blood and tissue safety intervention, people in this part of Florida regularly travel within and between these three counties and may not recognize that they have been in an area of active ZIKV transmission. This information has been added to CDC\\u2019s webpage used to communicate epidemiological information about ZIKV to the blood and tissue collection community.The potential increased risk to blood and tissue safety, and particularly to semen, in this area due to CDC\\u2019s announcement is considered to be very low. However, as a precaution, the Food and Drug Administration is informing establishments that collect tissues (i.e., human cell, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products \\u2013 HCT/Ps) and blood components of the potential increased risk, so they may consider whether and how this new information impacts their practices.\\xa0Also see the FDA\\u2019s communication to tissue establishments: Important Information for Human Cell, Tissue and Cellular and Tissue-based Product (HCT/P) Establishments Regarding Zika Virus\\xa0and the\\xa0FDA\\u2019s communication to blood establishments: Important Information for Blood Establishments Regarding Zika VirusEmergency Use Authorization (EUA)While many people with Zika virus infection experience no symptoms, the virus can pose potentially serious risks to the public health. Access to a diagnostic test that can identify patients with Zika virus infections is critical to supporting response efforts and expanding domestic readiness. Potential links between Zika virus infection and neurological complications (i.e., Guillain-Barr\\xe9 Syndrome), as well as microcephaly and other poor pregnancy outcomes associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy,\\xa0 have also increased the importance of having a diagnostic test available for Zika virus. As there are no commercially available diagnostic tests cleared or approved by the FDA for the detection of Zika virus infection, it was determined that an EUA is crucial to ensure timely access to a diagnostic tool.An EUA is a tool that FDA can use to allow the use of certain medical products for emergencies based on scientific data.\\xa0 The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has declared that circumstances exist to allow the emergency use of authorized diagnostic tests for Zika virus infection, such as the Zika MAC-ELISA.Draft EUA review templates for Zika are available to product sponsors/manufacturers by email request to: CDRH-ZIKA-Templates@fda.hhs.govLaboratory personnel using Zika diagnostic assays under EUA are encouraged to report performance concerns directly to FDA at CDRH-EUA-Reporting@fda.hhs.gov, in addition to reporting concerns to the manufacturer.Note about the LightMix\\xae Zika rRT-PCR Test (Roche Molecular Systems Inc.): In response to Roche Molecular Systems Inc.\\u2019s request dated March 10, 2017 to withdraw the LightMix\\xae Zika rRT-PCR Test due to technical performance and business considerations, on March 13, 2017 FDA revoked the EUA for emergency use of the LightMix\\xae Zika rRT-PCR Test.\\xa0 As of March 13, 2017, the LightMix\\xae Zika rRT-PCR Test that was authorized by FDA for use by clinical laboratories for the qualitative detection of RNA from Zika virus is no longer authorized by FDA.Zika diagnostic tests currently authorized under EUANucleic acid testing-based assays (molecular tests) - detect genetic material in samples of bodily fluids, such as serum and urine, to diagnose active Zika infectionAptima Zika Virus assay (Hologic, Inc.)Gene-RADAR\\xae Zika Virus Test (Nanobiosym Diagnostics, Inc.)RealStar Zika Virus RT-PCR Kit U.S. (altona Diagnostics GmbH)RealTime ZIKA (Abbott Molecular, Inc.)Sentosa\\xae SA ZIKV RT-PCR Test (Vela Diagnostics USA, Inc.)Trioplex rRT-PCR (CDC)VERSANT\\xae Zika RNA 1.0 Assay (kPCR) Kit (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.)xMAP\\xae MultiFLEX\\u2122 Zika RNA Assay (Luminex Corporation)Zika Virus Detection by RT-PCR (ARUP Laboratories)Zika Virus Real-time RT-PCR Test (Viracor Eurofins)Zika Virus RNA Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR (Quest Diagnostics Infectious Disease, Inc.)Zika ELITe MGB\\xae Kit U.S. (ELITechGroup Inc.

Reviewing the use of innovative strategies to help suppress the population of virus-carrying mosquitoes is one of many activities in which FDA is engaged to help mitigate the threat of vector-borne epidemics, such as Zika.\\xa0FDA\\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine reviewed information in an Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) file from Oxitec, Ltd., regarding the company\\u2019s genetically engineered line of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (OX513A), with the intent of suppressing the population of that mosquito at the release site(s). Ae. aegypti is known to transmit the debilitating human virus-caused diseases Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.\\xa0 More: Oxitec MosquitoOn March 11, 2016, in compliance with FDA regulations, FDA released for public comment a draft environmental assessment (EA)\\xa0(PDF, 33 MB) submitted by Oxitec, Ltd., that assesses the potential environmental impacts of a field trial of the company\\u2019s genetically engineered (GE) Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (OX513A) in Key Haven, Florida. Ae. aegypti is known to transmit potentially debilitating human viral diseases, including Zika, dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. The FDA also released a preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI)\\xa0(PDF, 148 KB)\\xa0that agrees with the draft EA\\u2019s conclusion that the field trial of such GE mosquitoes will not result in significant impacts on the environment.The goal of the proposed field trial is to determine whether released Oxitec GE mosquitoes will mate with local wild-type Aedes aegypti and suppress their population at the release site. The proposed study is not seeking to evaluate whether release of Oxitec\\u2019s GE mosquitoes will reduce Zika virus transmission. Oxitec\\u2019s mosquitoes are one possible approach that could be incorporated into an integrated program to help mitigate the threat of vector-borne epidemics; however, it is too early to say with any certainty whether such an approach would be successful.\\xa0\\xa0The public comment period for the draft Environmental Assessment and preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact concerning investigational use of Oxitec OX513A mosquitoes closed on May 13, 2016. Because this is a first of its kind application, FDA understands how important the public comment period process is.Update - August 5, 2016:\\xa0FDA Releases Final Environmental Assessment for Genetically Engineered Mosquito - FDA has completed the environmental review for a proposed field trial to determine whether the release of Oxitec Ltd.\\u2019s genetically engineered (GE) mosquitoes (OX513A) will suppress the local Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the release area at Key Haven, Florida. After considering thousands of public comments, FDA has published a final environmental assessment (EA) (PDF, 3 MB)\\xa0and finding of no significant impact (FONSI) (PDF, 198 KB)\\xa0that agrees with the EA\\u2019s conclusion that the proposed field trial will not have significant impacts on the environment.FDA\\u2019s finalization of the EA and FONSI does not mean that Oxitec\\u2019s GE mosquitos are approved for commercial use. Oxitec is responsible for ensuring all other local, state, and federal requirements are met before conducting the proposed field trial, and, together with its local partner, the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, to determine whether and when to begin the proposed field trial in Key Haven, Florida.January 18, 2017: FDA Requests Comments on Documents Related to Certain Biotechnology and Mosquito-related Products\\xa0- FDA is requesting public comment on a draft revised guidance\\xa0(PDF, 200 KB)\\xa0on the regulation of animals with intentionally altered genomic DNA, including animals produced through the use of genome editing and genetic engineering, and a draft guidance (PDF, 74 KB) that clarifies which mosquito-related products FDA regulates and which such products EPA regulates, regardless of whether these mosquito-related products are developed using biotechnology.

FDA is prepared to evaluate the safety and efficacy of any investigational vaccines and therapeutics that might be developed to help mitigate this outbreak.Diagnostics: There are no commercially available diagnostic tests cleared by FDA for the detection of Zika virus. FDA encourages commercial diagnostic developers and researchers developing laboratory developed tests for Zika virus to submit an EUA request. FDA will work interactively with developers to support such requests. See Zika Virus Diagnostic Development\\xa0for information on FDA support for Zika virus diagnostic development and Emergency Use Authorization for information about Zika virus diagnostics available under EUA.To help Zika diagnostic manufacturers assess traceability of their tests (a requirement for Emergency Use Authorization), FDA has created the FDA Zika Virus Reference Materials for NAT-based IVD devices, available upon request to Zika device developers who have a pre-EUA submission with the agency and have established the analytical and clinical performance of their assay. View an infographic about the FDA Zika Virus Reference Materials (PDF, 120 KB)Fraudulent ProductsUnfortunately, during outbreak situations, fraudulent products claiming to prevent, treat or cure a disease almost always appear. FDA monitors for fraudulent products and false product claims related to the Zika virus and takes appropriate action to protect consumers. Consumers who have seen these fraudulent products or false claims are encouraged to report them to the FDA.Using Insect Repellents SafelyAll insect repellents, including products combined with sunscreen, should be used according to instructions on the label.Use insect repellents that contain active ingredients registered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use on skin and clothing. EPA registration of insect repellent active ingredients indicates the materials have been reviewed and approved for human safety and effectiveness when applied according to instructions on the label.Don\\'t use insect repellent on babies.

Also see: Workshop in Brief \\xa0summary More About FDA\\'s RoleFDA is committed to working with the global community as it responds to the Zika virus outbreak. The FDA has a critical role in facilitating the development, and availability of investigational products for use against emerging infectious diseases, such as the Zika virus.FDA is actively working with our Federal colleagues at the CDC, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical\\xa0Advanced\\xa0Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and\\xa0is prepared to evaluate the safety and efficacy of any investigational vaccines and therapeutics\\xa0that might be developed to help mitigate this outbreak. The agency is also encouraging development of diagnostic tests that may be useful for identifying the presence of the virus, and is taking steps to help ensure the safety of our nation\\u2019s blood supply.While FDA cannot comment on the development of specific medical products, it\\u2019s important to note that every FDA regulatory decision is based on a risk-benefit assessment of scientific data that includes the context of use for the product and the patient population being studied. Approaches that will be able to show whether a product has a favorable risk-benefit profile for its proposed use may require careful planning. This may prove challenging for Zika virus since its symptoms are often mild or nonspecific.Emergency use: FDA stands ready to use our authorities to the fullest extent to help facilitate the development and availability of products for Zika virus, as we did during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Under the FDA\\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) mechanism, the agency can enable the use of an unapproved medical product, or the unapproved use of an approved medical product, during\\xa0emergencies, when, among other circumstances, there are no\\xa0adequate approved, and available alternatives. An EUA is an important mechanism that\\xa0allows broader access to available medical products under specific circumstances.Blood supply: FDA is responsible for regulatory oversight of the U.S. blood supply.

Most people never know that they have been infected with the virus.\\xa0It is estimated that four\\xa0out of five people with Zika virus infections have no symptoms at all.\\xa0When symptoms do occur, the most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (red eyes). Even in those who develop symptoms, the illness is usually mild, with symptoms lasting from several days to a week. A pregnant woman applies mosquito repellant. Using insect repellants will help to protect her from being bitten by a mosquito that may be carrying a virus such as Zika; this will also protect her unborn baby from the virus. (Image: CDC/Division of Vector-borne Diseases)Locations AffectedPrior to 2015, Zika virus outbreaks had occurred in areas of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. However, in May 2015, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert \\xa0(PDF, 199 KB) regarding the first confirmed Zika virus infection in Brazil. Currently, outbreaks are occurring in many countries.Imported Zika virus disease\\xa0cases have been reported in returning travelers. These imported cases could potentially result in local spread of the virus in some areas of the continental\\xa0United States.On July 29, 2016, CDC announced that likely local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission has been reported in the continental United States. Locally transmitted Zika virus has also been reported in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.Guillain-Barr\\xe9 SyndromeSince the outbreak in Brazil began, we have seen reports of Guillain-Barr\\xe9 syndrome (a disorder\\xa0in which the immune system attacks the nervous system) and birth defects.\\xa0\\xa0More: Zika Virus Disease Q&A, from CDCPregnancyZika virus can be transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have concluded, after careful review of existing evidence, that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly,\\xa0a condition in which a baby\\u2019s brain and head is smaller than expected,\\xa0and other severe fetal brain defects. In the April 13, 2016\\xa0report \\xa0published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the CDC authors describe a rigorous weighing of evidence using established scientific criteria.The finding that Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly and other severe fetal brain defects means that a woman who is infected with Zika during pregnancy has an increased risk of having a baby with these health problems. It does not mean, however, that all women who have Zika virus infection during pregnancy will have babies with problems. As has been seen during the current Zika outbreak, some infected women have delivered babies that appear to be healthy.

Reviewing the use of innovative strategies to help suppress the population of virus-carrying mosquitoes is one of many activities in which FDA is engaged to help mitigate the threat of vector-borne epidemics, such as Zika.\\xa0FDA\\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine reviewed information in an Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) file from Oxitec, Ltd., regarding the company\\u2019s genetically engineered line of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (OX513A), with the intent of suppressing the population of that mosquito at the release site(s). Ae. aegypti is known to transmit the debilitating human virus-caused diseases Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya.\\xa0 More: Oxitec MosquitoOn March 11, 2016, in compliance with FDA regulations, FDA released for public comment a draft environmental assessment (EA)\\xa0(PDF, 33 MB) submitted by Oxitec, Ltd., that assesses the potential environmental impacts of a field trial of the company\\u2019s genetically engineered (GE) Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (OX513A) in Key Haven, Florida. Ae. aegypti is known to transmit potentially debilitating human viral diseases, including Zika, dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. The FDA also released a preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI)\\xa0(PDF, 148 KB)\\xa0that agrees with the draft EA\\u2019s conclusion that the field trial of such GE mosquitoes will not result in significant impacts on the environment.The goal of the proposed field trial is to determine whether released Oxitec GE mosquitoes will mate with local wild-type Aedes aegypti and suppress their population at the release site. The proposed study is not seeking to evaluate whether release of Oxitec\\u2019s GE mosquitoes will reduce Zika virus transmission. Oxitec\\u2019s mosquitoes are one possible approach that could be incorporated into an integrated program to help mitigate the threat of vector-borne epidemics; however, it is too early to say with any certainty whether such an approach would be successful.\\xa0\\xa0The public comment period for the draft Environmental Assessment and preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact concerning investigational use of Oxitec OX513A mosquitoes closed on May 13, 2016. Because this is a first of its kind application, FDA understands how important the public comment period process is.Update - August 5, 2016:\\xa0FDA Releases Final Environmental Assessment for Genetically Engineered Mosquito - FDA has completed the environmental review for a proposed field trial to determine whether the release of Oxitec Ltd.\\u2019s genetically engineered (GE) mosquitoes (OX513A) will suppress the local Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the release area at Key Haven, Florida.

Also see: Workshop in Brief \\xa0summary More About FDA's RoleFDA is committed to working with the global community as it responds to the Zika virus outbreak. The FDA has a critical role in facilitating the development, and availability of investigational products for use against emerging infectious diseases, such as the Zika virus.FDA is actively working with our Federal colleagues at the CDC, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Biomedical\\xa0Advanced\\xa0Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and\\xa0is prepared to evaluate the safety and efficacy of any investigational vaccines and therapeutics\\xa0that might be developed to help mitigate this outbreak. The agency is also encouraging development of diagnostic tests that may be useful for identifying the presence of the virus, and is taking steps to help ensure the safety of our nation\\u2019s blood supply.While FDA cannot comment on the development of specific medical products, it\\u2019s important to note that every FDA regulatory decision is based on a risk-benefit assessment of scientific data that includes the context of use for the product and the patient population being studied. Approaches that will be able to show whether a product has a favorable risk-benefit profile for its proposed use may require careful planning. This may prove challenging for Zika virus since its symptoms are often mild or nonspecific.Emergency use: FDA stands ready to use our authorities to the fullest extent to help facilitate the development and availability of products for Zika virus, as we did during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. Under the FDA\\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) mechanism, the agency can enable the use of an unapproved medical product, or the unapproved use of an approved medical product, during\\xa0emergencies, when, among other circumstances, there are no\\xa0adequate approved, and available alternatives. An EUA is an important mechanism that\\xa0allows broader access to available medical products under specific circumstances.Blood supply: FDA is responsible for regulatory oversight of the U.S. blood supply. FDA works closely with other parts of the Public Health Service (PHS) to establish blood standards, and to identify and respond to potential threats to blood safety or supply.\\xa0More: Keeping Blood Transfusions Safe: FDA's Multi-layered Protections for Donated BloodContact FDAGeneral Info/Consumers1-888-INFO-FDA / (1-888-463-6332)Report a Fraudulent Zika ProductReport form and instructionsPressOffice of Media Affairsfdaoma@fda.hhs.gov301-796-4540CliniciansEmergency Investigational New Drug (EIND) Applications for Antiviral Products301-796-1500Diagnostic Product Sponsors/Manufacturers - EUA TemplatesDraft EUA review templates for Zika are available by email request to: CDRH-ZIKA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov\\xa0Subscribe to email updates\\xa0from the FDA Medical Countermeasures Initiative (MCMi)\\xa0to receive FDA Zika response updates by email\\nRelated Links\\nFDA Birth Control Chart - August 2016\\xa0(PDF - 2.6MB)\\nZika Virus Disease Q&A (CDC)\\nHow to Avoid Bug Bites (CDC)\\nQ&A: Zika Virus Infection and Pregnancy (CDC)\\nZika and Pregnancy: 6 Tips for Staying Healthy (HHS ASPR)\\n10 Questions About Zika: The CDC Answers\\nAbout Emergency Use Authorization\\nThe FDA's Drug Review Process: Ensuring Drugs Are Safe and Effective\\nZika Virus Risk-Based Preparedness and Response Guidance for States (CDC)\\nRoadmap for parents of babies with congenital Zika syndrome (CDC)\\nRoadmap for parents of babies infected with Zika before birth who appear healthy (CDC)\\nGuidance for areas with local Zika virus transmission in the continental U.S. and Hawaii (CDC)\\nResources for Healthcare Providers\\nZika Information for Health Care Providers (CDC)\\nWhen to test for Zika virus (CDC)\\nZika: Resources at Your Fingertips, for health care providers (PDF, 376 KB, from HHS/ASPR)\\nPromoting Stress Management for Pregnant Women during the Zika Virus Disease Outbreak: A Resource for Healthcare Providers, and Planning Resources (HHS)\\nTesting for Zika Virus (CDC)\\nGuidance for U.S. Laboratories Testing for Zika Virus Infection (CDC)\\nWHO Zika app for healthcare providers, for Andriod and iOS - available in multiple languages\\nResource Guide for States and Communities Caring for Infants and Children Affected by Zika Virus (HRSA)\\nRecursos em Portugues (Resources in Portuguese)\\nAtualiza\\xe7\\xf5es de resposta v\\xedrus Zika do FDA\\nDesenvolvimento de diagn\\xf3stico dp v\\xedrus Zika\\nAtualizacoes de virus Zika de CDC\\nDez duvidas sobre o Zika: O CDC responde\\nDoenca do virus Zika (Organizacao Mundial da Saude - WHO)\\nPerguntas e respostas \\u2013 Microcefalia (Portal da Saude, Brasil)\\nRecursos en espanol (Resources in Spanish)\\nActualizaciones de la respuesta de la FDA al virus del Zika\\nCreaci\\xf3n de pruebas de diagn\\xf3stico para el virus del Zika\\nGu\\xeda de M\\xe9todos Anticonceptivos (Birth Control Chart Spanish - 8/2016)\\xa0(PDF - 433KB)\\n16 de febrero 2016 - Comunicado de Prensa de la FDA: La FDA da a conocer recomendaciones para reducir el riesgo de transmisi\\xf3n sangu\\xednea del virus del Zika en los Estados Unidos\\nEl virus del Zika (Centros para el Control y la Prevencion de Enfermedades)\\nZika, Infeccion por Virus (Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud)\\nMicrocefalia (Organizacion Mundial de la Salud)\\nPreguntas y respuestas sobre el zika y el embarazo (Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud)\\nArme su propio kit de prevencion contra el Zika (Centros para el Control y la Prevencion de Enfermedades)\\nPrevencion de picaduras de mosquitos (Estados Unidos)\\nLo que sabemos y lo que no sabemos del Zika\\nAyude a controlar los mosquitos que transmiten los virus del dengue, chikunguna y Zika\\nKit de prevencion del Zika para mujeres embarazadas\\nEmbarazada?
